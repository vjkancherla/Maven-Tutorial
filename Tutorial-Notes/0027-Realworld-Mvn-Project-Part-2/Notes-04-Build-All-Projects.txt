================================
BUILD THE MULTI MODULE PROJECT
================================

[1] We will build the multi-module project from the directory in which the Parent POM exists (Sample-Projects/multi-module-product-app)

>> cd Sample-Projects/multi-module-product-app

>> mvn clean install

What Maven does at this time is:
    - Scans and creates a graph of the build order, based on project dependencies. 
      You will see this under "Reactor Build Order:" in the console output

    =====
    [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
    [INFO] Reactor Build Order:
    [INFO]
    [INFO] product-app-parent                                                 [pom]
    [INFO] product-services                                                   [jar]
    [INFO] product-web Maven Webapp                                           [war]
    =====

    - Build the "product-services" project, creates a jar and stores it in the local repo (~/.m2/..)  
      With this, the "product-services" project is available to be used as a dependency for other projects.
    

[2] Note that we wil still see build errors when "product-web" is being built. 
    This is becuase we not yet defined the dependency between product-web and product-service.
    We will do that next.
