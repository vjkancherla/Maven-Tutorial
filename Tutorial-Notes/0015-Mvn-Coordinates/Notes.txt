MAVEN COORDINATES
===================
- Maven coordinates are a way of uniquely identifying a particular project artifact (like a JAR file) in the Maven ecosystem. 
- These coordinates are part of Maven's dependency mechanism, which allows you to declare dependencies for your project 
  and fetch them from a centralized repository (like Maven Central).

There are five primary coordinates:

- GroupId: 
    Typically represents the organization or project that the artifact belongs to. 
    It's usually in a reverse domain name format. For example, the GroupId for all Maven-managed projects from 
    Apache Software Foundation starts with "org.apache".
     
- ArtifactId: 
    Represents the name of the project/artifact. This is usually the name of the library or tool. For example, for Apache Commons Lang, 
    the ArtifactId would be "commons-lang3".

- Version: 
    Represents the version of the artifact. This is crucial, as projects evolve over time and users may want to depend on 
    a specific version of a library.

- Packaging (optional, defaults to "jar"): 
    Represents the type of the artifact, such as JAR, WAR, or POM. The packaging can determine how the artifact is used. 
    For instance, JARs might be used as libraries in other projects, while WARs are typically deployed to web servers.

- Classifier (optional):
     This is an additional classifier to differentiate artifacts that were built from the same POM but have different contents. 
     For instance, you might have JARs that are compiled with different Java versions or are meant for different platforms.

EXAMPLE:
    To tell Maven to fetch version 3.12.0 of the commons-lang3 artifact from the organization org.apache.commons:
    -----
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>
        <artifactId>commons-lang3</artifactId>
        <version>3.12.0</version>
    </dependency>
