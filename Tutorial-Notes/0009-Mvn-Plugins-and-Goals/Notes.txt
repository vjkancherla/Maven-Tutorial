MVN PLUGINS AND GOALS
=======================

PLUGINS
-------
- Plugins in Maven are responsible for extending the build process beyond what's provided by default.
- Maven plugins are defined in your project's POM file within the <build> section.
- Plugins can be used to perform tasks such as compiling code, running tests, generating documentation, packaging artifacts, and more.
- Plugins can also be used for custom tasks like code generation or integration with external tools and services.
- Some commonly used Maven plugins include the Maven Compiler Plugin, Maven Surefire Plugin (for running tests), Maven JAR Plugin, and Maven Release Plugin.


GOALS
------
- Goals are specific tasks or operations provided by Maven plugins.
- Each plugin typically defines a set of goals that you can use to customize the build process.


COMMANDS
---------
- mvn <PLUGIN>:help
     list all goals in a specific plugin
     eg: mvn failsafe:help

- mvn <PLUGIN>:<GOAL>
    to run a specific goal
    eg: mvn failsafe:integration-test


EXAMPLES
----------
- mvn archetype:generate
    run the "generate" goal of archetype plugin

- mvn install:install
    run the install goal (this is automatically inferred. We just run mvn install)
