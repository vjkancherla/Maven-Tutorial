MVN PROPERTIES
========================
- Maven properties are a key feature in pom.xml files that allow for the customization and configuration of the build process. 
- They can be used to inject dynamic values into the Maven build lifecycle and can be defined in various scopes, 
  such as within the pom.xml itself, user settings, environment variables, or command-line parameters.


BUILT-IN PROPERTIES
---------------------
- Built-in Maven properties are predefined variables that you can use to refer to specific states or settings of the 
  Maven environment within your project's pom.xml, profiles.xml, or settings.xml. 
- They provide a convenient way to access project-related information without hard-coding values that may change from 
  one environment to another or as the project evolves.


BUILT-IN "PROJECT" PROPERTIES
------------------------------
These properties refer to the aspects of your Maven project as defined in the pom.xml file:

${project.groupId}: The group ID of the project.
${project.artifactId}: The artifact ID of the project.
${project.version}: The version of the project.
${project.name}: The name of the project.
${project.description}: The description of the project.
${project.build.finalName}: The final name of the file created when the built project is packaged.


BUILT-IN "SETTINGS" PROPERTIES
------------------------------
These properties refer to settings from Maven's settings.xml file:

${settings.localRepository}: The path to the local repository on your machine.


BUILT-IN "ENVIRONMENT" PROPERTIES
------------------------------------
These allow you to access system environment variables:

${env.JAVA_HOME}: The path to the Java SDK installation in the system environment.
${env.HOME}: The path to the user home directory.



BUILT-IN "JAVA" PROPERTIES
------------------------------------
These properties expose values from the Java system properties:

${java.version}: The version of Java being used to run Maven.
${java.vendor}: The vendor of the Java SDK.
${os.name}: The name of the operating system Maven is running on.
${os.arch}: The architecture of the operating system.
${os.version}: The version of the operating system.
