MVN PHASES
===============

A Maven phase represents a stage in the Maven build lifecycle. Each phase is responsible for a specific task.

Here are some of the most important phases in the default build lifecycle:

    - validate: check if all information necessary for the build is available
    - compile: compile the source code
    - test-compile: compile the test source code
    - test: run unit tests
    - package: package compiled source code into the distributable format (jar, war, …)
    - integration-test: process and deploy the package if needed to run integration tests
    - install: install the package to a LOCAL repository
    - deploy: copy the package to the REMOTE repository


Phases are executed in a specific order. This means that if we run a specific phase using the command: 

    - mvn <PHASE>

It not only executes the specified phase, but all the preceding phases as well.

For example, if we run the deploy phase (mvn deploy), which is the last phase in the default build lifecycle, it’ll execute all the phases 
before the deploy phase as well
