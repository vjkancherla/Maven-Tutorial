==================================
MAVEN's BILL OF MATERIALS (BOM)
==================================

READ THIS: https://reflectoring.io/maven-bom/

- The Bill Of Material is a special POM file that groups dependency versions that are known to be valid and tested to work together. 

- This will reduce the developers' pain of having to test the compatibility of different versions and reduce the chances to have version mismatches.

- The BOM file has:
   - a pom packaging type: <packaging>pom</packaging>.
   - a dependencyManagement section that lists the dependencies of a project.
