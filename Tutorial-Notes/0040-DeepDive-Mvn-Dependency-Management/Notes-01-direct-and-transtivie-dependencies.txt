DIRECT AND TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCIES
======================================

Direct Dependencies:
    - These are dependencies that you explicitly add to your project's pom.xml. 
    - They represent libraries or modules that you directly use in your project.

    EXAMPLE:
        -----
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>log4j</groupId>
                <artifactId>log4j</artifactId>
                <version>1.2.17</version>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
        -----


Transitive Dependencies:
    - These are the dependencies that your direct dependencies require to function. 
    - A project that we include as a dependency in our project, like the logging library above, can declare its own dependencies in a pom.xml file. 
    - Maven will automatically pull in transitive dependencies to ensure that everything your project needs is available.

    How It Works: 
        - Suppose Library A depends on Library B. 
        - If your project adds Library A as a direct dependency, Maven will automatically fetch Library B for you 
          because it's a transitive dependency of Library A.

    Issues: 
        - Transitive dependencies can lead to dependency conflicts. For example, if two of your direct dependencies 
          both require DIFFERENT versions of the same transitive dependency, Maven has to resolve this conflict.
