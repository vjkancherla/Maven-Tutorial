So far, we have created two standalone projects:
 - product-services [jar]
 - product-web [webapp]

 We were able to build product-services without issues.

 However, we were not able to build product-web because the Servlets reference the classes defined in product-services, 
 but have not defined any project dependencies (i.e., how does product-web know about product-services?).

 The next step is to create a multi-module maven project and defined the project dependencies.
