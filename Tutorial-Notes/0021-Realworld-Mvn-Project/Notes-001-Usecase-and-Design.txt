==========
USE-CASE
==========
We will be building a "Web Application to Manage Products" called "Product-Web".

Using the Web Application, we will:
    - Add new Products
    - Lookup existing Products


========================
APPLICATION DESIGN
=========================
The Application will be build using three separate layers:
    - Web layer
    - Business logic layer
    - Data acess layer

Web layer:
    - Servlets

Business logic layer:
    - POJO

Data acess layer:
    - POJO DAO

NOTE: "Spring" will be used for dependency injection


===========
UNIT TESTS
===========
Unit tests will be written to cover all layers.


==========================
MAVEN PROJECTS DESIGN
==========================
[1] A "Standalone/JAR" MVN project called "Product-Services" will be created to anchor
    - Business logic layer
    - Data acess layer

[2] A "Web/WAR" MVN project called "Product-Web" will be used to anchor the Web layer.
    - The "Product-Services" project will be added as a dependency
