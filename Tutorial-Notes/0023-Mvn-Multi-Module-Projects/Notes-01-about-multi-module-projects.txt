MAVEN MULTI MODULE PROJECTS
==============================
- Maven multi-module projects, also known as multi-module builds or multi-project builds, are a way to manage and 
  build multiple Maven projects as a single project.

- In a multi-module project, you have a parent project that aggregates one or more child projects, allowing you to manage them collectively. 

- Multi-module projects are particularly useful for large software projects where different parts of the application are 
  developed and maintained separately but need to be built and managed together.


Here are some key concepts and benefits of Maven multi-module projects:

- Parent Project: 
    - The parent project serves as the root of the multi-module project. 
    - It contains configuration information and dependencies that are common to all child projects. 
    - The parent project is defined in a POM (Project Object Model) file called pom.xml.

- Child Projects: 
    - Child projects are individual Maven projects that are part of the multi-module project. 
    - Each child project has its own pom.xml file and may contain its own source code, resources, and configuration.

- Dependency Management: 
    - Child projects can depend on other child projects within the same multi-module project. 
    - Maven manages these dependencies automatically, ensuring that the correct order of building and dependency resolution is maintained.

- Build Lifecycle: 
    - When you build the parent project, Maven automatically builds all of its child projects in the correct order 
      according to their dependencies. 
    - This simplifies the build process, as you can build the entire application with a single Maven command.

- Inheritance and Overriding: 
    - Child projects inherit configuration settings and dependencies from the parent project's POM. 
    - However, you can also override and customize these settings in the child project's POM.

- Reusability: 
    - Child projects can be reused in other multi-module projects, making it easier to create and maintain libraries or common components.
