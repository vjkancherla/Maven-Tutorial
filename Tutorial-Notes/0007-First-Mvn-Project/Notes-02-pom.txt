POM FILE
=========
- A Maven POM (Project Object Model) file is an XML file that serves as the core configuration file for a Maven-based project. 

- It contains essential information about the project, its dependencies, build settings, and plugins. Maven uses the information 
  in the POM file to manage the project's lifecycle and build process.

Here are the key elements and sections you'll typically find in a Maven POM file:

[1] Project Information:
<modelVersion>: Specifies the version of the POM model. It should be set to "4.0.0" for modern Maven projects.
<groupId>: Identifies the group or organization to which the project belongs.
<artifactId>: Specifies the unique name of the project or module.
<version>: Defines the version of the project.
<packaging>: Specifies the type of artifact produced by the project (e.g., JAR, WAR, POM, etc.).
<name>: A human-readable name for the project.
<description>: A brief description of the project.

[2] Project Dependencies:
<dependencies>: This section lists the project's dependencies on external libraries and artifacts. 
    Dependencies are specified with <dependency> elements, each containing information about the dependency's groupId, 
    artifactId, and version.

[3] Build Configuration:
<build>: This section defines the build configuration for the project.
<plugins>: Lists the plugins used for the build process, such as the compiler plugin, test plugin, and others.
<finalName>: Specifies the final name of the project's output artifact.
<sourceDirectory>: Sets the source code directory.
<resources>: Configures additional resource directories for the build process.
